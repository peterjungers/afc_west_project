    <p>The Western Division of the American Football Conference is a continuation of the American Football League's Western Division. The AFL began play in 1960, consisting of eight teams in two divisions, and soon rivaled the older National Football League in quality and popularity. Because of this, the two leagues were fully merged by 1970. The AFL became the AFC, with most former NFL teams comprising the new National Football Conference (NFC). Though other teams have been added or removed from the division over the years, the current four teams in the AFC West are the same franchises who first competed as division rivals over 60 years ago.</p>
    <p>This site lists the regular season and postseason records for these four teams since their inaugural season in 1960. Super Bowl records are also listed, as are records for AFL Championship Games, which ended after the 1969 season.</p>
    <p>Site designed by Peter Jungers, September 2022, as a project to become more familiar with the Flask web framework for Python. It is heavily indebted to the excellent Flask tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH" target="_blank">Corey Schafer</a>. Other learning outcomes were: a better understanding of HTML, CSS, N-Tier architecture, web scraping, database construction, and object relational mapping using SQLAlchemy.</p>
