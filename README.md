# AFC West Records
This was my first Flask project after going through Corey Schafer's Flask tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH). It lists all records for the NFL's AFC West division for the regular season, postseason, and Super Bowls.

#### Notes for improvement:
A new table can be made for team achievements; as of now, they are hard-coding in. This table can also be used to determine the data in the "Highest Achievement" column in the "Postseason" table. Secondly, the dropdown menu does not work when scaled to mobile. I would like to learn the CSS required in order to make this work.
